          ],
          "answer": "A) f(x) = a(b^x)",
          "explanation": "The general form of an exponential growth/decay function is f(x) = a(b^x), where 'a' is the initial value, 'b' is the growth/decay rate, and 'x' is the number of periods."

          "answer": "B) 5 days",
          "explanation": "The substance decays to 25% in two half-lives (since 0.5^2 = 0.25). Therefore, the half-life is 10 days / 2 = 5 days."
