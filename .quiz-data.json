          "answer": "Spasticity is a condition characterized by abnormal muscle tightness and stiffness due to prolonged muscle contraction, often seen in neuromuscular disorders like stroke or spinal cord injuries.",
          "explanation": "Spasticity results from damage to the motor pathways in the central nervous system, leading to hyperexcitability of the stretch reflexes and involuntary muscle contractions."

          "text": "Explain how the Brunnstrom Approach is used in physical therapy for stroke patients.",
          "answer": "The Brunnstrom Approach is a therapeutic method that leverages synergistic movement patterns to help stroke patients regain motor control. It involves guiding patients through stages of recovery, from flaccidity to voluntary movement, by using reflexes and synergies.",
          "explanation": "This approach recognizes that stroke patients often progress through predictable stages of motor recovery and uses these stages to tailor therapy, encouraging the use of reflexive movements before advancing to voluntary control."

          "text": "Compare and contrast hypertonia and hypotonia in neuromuscular conditions.",
          "answer": "Hypertonia is characterized by increased muscle tone and stiffness, often seen in conditions like cerebral palsy or stroke. Hypotonia, on the other hand, involves decreased muscle tone and floppiness, commonly observed in disorders like Down syndrome or muscular dystrophy.",
          "explanation": "Hypertonia results from overactive muscle contractions due to CNS damage, while hypotonia arises from underactive muscle responses, often due to peripheral nerve or muscle dysfunction."

          "answer": "1. Locomotor training: Using treadmill exercises with body-weight support to encourage rhythmic stepping and improve gait. 2. Cueing strategies: Using visual or auditory cues (e.g., lines on the floor or metronome beats) to help initiate and maintain movement.",
          "explanation": "These interventions address the slow movement (bradykinesia) characteristic of Parkinson's by providing external stimuli to overcome motor planning deficits and promote fluid motion."

          "text": "How might constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) benefit a patient recovering from a stroke that affected their dominant arm?",
          "answer": "CIMT would involve restraining the unaffected arm, forcing the patient to use the affected arm for daily tasks. This promotes neuroplasticity and functional recovery by intensively training the impaired limb.",
          "explanation": "CIMT works by overcoming 'learned non-use' of the affected limb and encouraging the brain to rewire itself through repetitive, task-specific practice."

          "answer": "PNF techniques are used to enhance strength, flexibility, and coordination by stimulating proprioceptors in muscles and joints. For spinal cord injury patients, PNF can help retrain neural pathways and improve functional movements like rolling or sitting.",
          "explanation": "PNF leverages the body's natural reflexes and patterns of movement to maximize recovery, making it particularly effective for patients with neurological damage."

          "answer": "Neuroplasticity allows the brain to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. In ALS, physical therapy can harness neuroplasticity to compensate for motor neuron loss by training alternative pathways to maintain function for as long as possible.",
          "explanation": "Although ALS is progressive, targeted exercises can optimize remaining neural capacity by reinforcing adaptive movements and delaying functional decline."

In Parkinson's disease, physical therapy leverages neuroplasticity to help patients develop compensatory movement strategies. For example, repetitive exercises like rhythmic auditory stimulation can help improve gait by reinforcing new neural pathways.",
          "explanation": "Neuroplasticity is crucial in Parkinson's rehabilitation because it allows the brain to adapt to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. Therapists use targeted exercises to promote the development of alternative pathways, enhancing motor function and slowing disease progression."

          "text": "Explain why the function f(x) = 200(0.85)^x represents exponential decay.",
          "answer": "The function represents exponential decay because the base (0.85) is between 0 and 1, indicating that the quantity decreases by 15% each period.",
          "explanation": "In exponential functions, if the base 'b' is 0 < b < 1, the function models decay. Here, 0.85 means the quantity decreases by 15% (since 1 - 0.15 = 0.85) each time period."

          "answer": "This function could model a savings account with an initial deposit of $1000 growing at an annual interest rate of 8%.",
          "explanation": "The initial value is $1000, and the base 1.08 indicates an 8% growth rate per year, typical of compound interest in savings accounts."
