          "text": "Which of the following is a common neuromuscular condition where physical therapists play an essential role?",
          "options": [
            "A) Multiple Sclerosis (MS)",
            "B) Type 2 Diabetes",

            "D) Asthma"
          ],
          "answer": "A) Multiple Sclerosis (MS)",
          "explanation": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neuromuscular condition that affects the central nervous system, and physical therapists play a crucial role in managing symptoms and improving mobility for patients with MS."

          "text": "Define the term 'Spasticity' as it relates to neuromuscular conditions.",
          "answer": "Spasticity is a condition characterized by stiff or rigid muscles and an inability to control those muscles, often due to damage to the nerve pathways in the brain or spinal cord.",
          "rubric": "1 point for defining spasticity, 1 point for mentioning its relation to nerve pathway damage.",
          "explanation": "Spasticity is a common symptom in neuromuscular conditions like Multiple Sclerosis or Spinal Cord Injury, where the muscles become overly active and stiff due to disrupted signals from the nervous system."

          "text": "What is the primary role of a physical therapist in managing patients with neuromuscular disorders?",
          "answer": "The primary role is to help patients improve mobility, manage symptoms, and enhance quality of life through exercises, stretches, and other therapeutic interventions.",
          "rubric": "1 point for mentioning mobility improvement, 1 point for symptom management, and 1 point for therapeutic interventions.",
          "explanation": "Physical therapists work with patients to develop personalized treatment plans that address their specific neuromuscular challenges, focusing on functional independence and pain reduction."

          "text": "Compare and contrast the roles of a physical therapist in treating a patient with Parkinson's Disease versus a patient with a Spinal Cord Injury.",
          "answer": "For Parkinson's Disease, the therapist focuses on improving balance, coordination, and reducing bradykinesia. For Spinal Cord Injury, the focus is on regaining motor control, strength, and possibly learning to use assistive devices. Both aim to improve quality of life but address different symptoms.",
          "rubric": "1 point for each condition's focus (balance/coordination vs. motor control/strength), 1 point for mentioning quality of life, and 1 point for contrasting the approaches.",
          "explanation": "Parkinson's Disease and Spinal Cord Injury require different therapeutic approaches due to their distinct symptoms and progression, but both benefit from physical therapy to enhance functional abilities."

          "text": "A patient with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) is experiencing muscle weakness. Describe two physical therapy interventions that could help this patient.",
          "answer": "1) Gentle range-of-motion exercises to maintain joint flexibility. 2) Strength training with light resistance to slow muscle atrophy.",
          "rubric": "1 point for each valid intervention (e.g., range-of-motion exercises, strength training).",
          "explanation": "ALS leads to progressive muscle weakness, so physical therapy aims to preserve function and delay complications through tailored exercises."

          "text": "How might Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) benefit a stroke patient with hemiparesis?",
          "answer": "CIMT encourages the use of the affected limb by restraining the unaffected limb, promoting neuroplasticity and improving motor function.",
          "rubric": "1 point for mentioning restraint of the unaffected limb, 1 point for promoting neuroplasticity, and 1 point for improving motor function.",
          "explanation": "CIMT leverages the brain's ability to rewire itself, helping stroke patients regain movement in affected limbs through repetitive practice."

          "category": "Communication",
          "text": "Explain why neuroplasticity is important in physical therapy for neuromuscular conditions.",
          "answer": "Neuroplasticity allows the brain to adapt and form new neural connections, enabling patients to regain lost functions or compensate for impairments through therapy.",
          "rubric": "1 point for defining neuroplasticity, 1 point for linking it to functional recovery, and 1 point for mentioning compensation.",
          "explanation": "Neuroplasticity is the foundation of rehabilitation, as it enables the nervous system to recover or adapt after injury, making therapy effective."

          "text": "Justify the use of the Brunnstrom Approach in stroke rehabilitation.",
          "answer": "The Brunnstrom Approach leverages synergistic movement patterns and spasticity to facilitate recovery, aligning with the natural progression of stroke recovery stages.",
          "rubric": "1 point for mentioning synergistic movements, 1 point for using spasticity, and 1 point for aligning with recovery stages.",
          "explanation": "This approach recognizes that patients often progress through predictable stages post-stroke, and therapy should adapt to these stages to maximize recovery."
